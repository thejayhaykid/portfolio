I am a software developer from Columbus, Ohio who is seeking a position that would allow me to incorporate my design agility and problem-solving skills in order to advance your business. As a developer with a design acumen, I am able to apply those skills to different architectural patterns to fit your company’s needs. Software development is not just my career, it is part of who I am and it’s what I love doing. I am looking for a new opportunity because I have been able to accomplish everything I set out to do in my current position and I am looking forward to new challenges and opportunities to grow and expand my knowledge of cutting edge technology.
