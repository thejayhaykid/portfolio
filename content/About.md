## Programming

My passion is learning new technologies and ways to implement them.

### Python

I am highly experienced with Python—a highly versatile language I have used in a variety of settings, including :

- Geospatial analysis (arcpy)
- Simple web scraping (beautiful soup, requests)
- A simple Discord bot (discord.py)
- Basic level web applications (django and flask tutorials)
- Excel scripting (openpyxl)
- Easy CLI applications (Click)
- Testing (pytest)

### Go

My main focus with this language has been on backend web development with some CLI applications as well.

### JavaScript

As the language of the Internet, JavaScript is a critical component to any web developers portfolio. I have taught myself a variety of JavaScript frameworks and have supported an internal project that used React. I have also used Vue.js in multiple personal projects.

I even have 2 certifications related to JavaScript from [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org): 

1. [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/thejayhaykid/responsive-web-design)
2. [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/thejayhaykid/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)
