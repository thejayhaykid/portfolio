# Jake Hayes

I am a software developer from Columbus, Ohio. I currently work for HMB Inc. as a software consultant. I graduated from The Ohio State University after the spring semester of 2017 with a major in Geographic Information Science and a minor in Design.

While with HMB, I have been with the same client. My role focuses primarily on supporting the main customer management system. This system is on a mainframe using COBOL and JCL and all other things mainframe related.

## Programming

However, this is not my preferred technology to be working with and I have been working hard on staying up to date with certain other technologies.

### Python

I feel the most comfortable with Python. It is a powerful language with a variety of capabilities. I have used it for many different projects inlcuding but not limited to: 

- Geospatial analysis (`arcpy`)
- Simple web scraping (`beautiful soup`, `requests`)
- A simple Discord bot (`discord.py`)
- Basic level web applications (`django` and `flask` tutorials)
- Excel scripting (`openpyxl`)
- Easy CLI applications (`Click`)
- Testing (`pytest`)

This isn't a complete list, I would love to answer any questions regarding these projects and I'd be happy to give more examples.

### Go

I am not as experienced in using Go as I am in Python. However, I have been using it on and off again for around two years. I have primarily focused on using it for backend web development with some CLI applications as well.

### JavaScript

At this point, it is nearly imposssible to argue that anything related to the web can be created without using JavaScript. I have traditionally tried to stay with vanilla JavaScript, but recently I have been learning about different JavaScript frameworks. I did support an internal project that used React. I have also used Vue.js in multiple personal projects.

### Other

More to come later.

## Design

With my background in design, I have been able to complete a few different personal projects that highlilght my affinity for the aesthetics of software. I also enjoy making both mobile and desktop wallpapers using whatever application will help me complete my vision the best.

### Adobe Illustrator

I have used Adobe Illustrator for multiple activities and programs. I have completed logo designs, illustrated covers for books and media guides, and made fun graphics for holidays.

### Adobe Photoshop

I have experience in Photoshop including digital painting, photo editing, and photo compositions. I have done a variety of sports related graphics for fun, as this is a passion of mine.

### Other

I have some small experience with other Adobe Creative Cloud products including InDesign, XD, Premiere Pro, AfterEffects, and Lightroom. Let me know if you have any questions related to my experience, as I would welcome the opportunity to review any questions or concerns regarding my experience and qualifications.
